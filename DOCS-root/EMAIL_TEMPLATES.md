# Phase 9: Customer Acquisition Email Templates

## Cold Outreach Email Templates

### Email 1: Initial Outreach (Personalized)

```
Subject: [Their Company] + AWS cost waste

Hi [Name],

Saw your [LinkedIn post / GitHub project about infrastructure automation].

We just launched DriftSentry — catches forgotten AWS resources automatically.

Most teams like yours waste $2-5K/month on infrastructure they spun up and forgot.

Free 14-day trial (no credit card): [link to /marketing]

If it finds waste, let's chat.

[Your name]
PS: Not relevant? Reply saying so, I'll remove you.
```

**Why this works:**
- Specific problem (not generic pitch)
- Clear ask (try free trial)
- Low commitment (14 days, no CC)
- Benefit obvious (find waste)
